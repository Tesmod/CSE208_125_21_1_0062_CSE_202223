This repository holds the python codes to implement two of the different examples of Dynamic Programming which are "Fibonacci Series" and "Power of a nummber"
These two programs  obey the dynamic nature of programming where there is no overlapping computations - i.e. answers of the previously computed problems are reused instead of performing the computations right from the beginning again.
